      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(team, players);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[1] = "Agnes";
      console.log(team, players);

      // however what happens when we update that array?
      /// now here is the problem!
      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way
      const anotherTeam = players.splice();

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const thirdTeam = [].concat(players);

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const fourthTeam = [...players];

      const fifthTeam = Array.from(players);

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      /*const programmer = person;
      programmer.number = 4;*/

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const anotherProgrammer = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 4 });
      console.log(anotherProgrammer, person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      // const thirdProgrammer = { ...person };
